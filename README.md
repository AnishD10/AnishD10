## 🎯 Hobbies (When I'm not coding... or pretending to)

- 🏋️‍♂️ Gym — I lift both weights and merge conflicts
- 🎧 Music — debugging with beats
- 🎮 Gaming — uninstalling rage edition
- ♟️ Chess — where I sacrifice my queen just to see what happens
- 📖 Reading — plot twists hit different when the protagonist debugs their life
- ✍️ Writing — mostly ideas, poems, and occasionally angry pseudocode
- 🛌 Sleeping — usually interrupted by the thought “did I commit that?”
